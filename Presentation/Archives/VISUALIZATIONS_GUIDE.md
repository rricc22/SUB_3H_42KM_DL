- Shows: Detailed HR fluctuations, realistic dynamics

**Sparse HR Quality:**
- Path: `../experiments/apple_watch_analysis/plots/validation_v2_workout_20241114_172333.png`
- HR samples: 48 over 71 min = **0.7 samples/min**
- Shows: Smooth interpolated line, less detail

**4-Panel Layout:**
1. Heart Rate over time
2. Speed over time
3. Elevation over time

## 📝 Tips for Effective Visualizations

### Do's ✅
- **Large and readable:** Don't squeeze small images
- **Add captions:** Explain what we're seeing
- **Highlight key points:** Use arrows/circles
- **Reference in speech:** "As you can see in this plot..."
- **Keep it simple:** 2-3 visualizations max

### Don'ts ❌
- **Too many plots:** Overwhelming, confusing
- **Too small:** Audience can't read
- **No explanation:** Don't assume meaning is obvious
- **Cluttered slides:** One main visual per slide
- **Low quality:** Use PNG, not compressed JPG

## 🎤 Speaking Points for Each Visualization

### Training Curves
> "Here we see the training curves for our best LSTM model. The blue line shows training loss, and orange shows validation loss. Notice how they converge around epoch 75, where early stopping kicked in. This demonstrates the model learns effectively without overfitting. The final validation MAE is approximately 8-10 BPM, approaching our target."

### Apple Watch Quality Comparison
> "These two plots illustrate a key finding in our Apple Watch dataset. On the left, a recent 2025 workout with 12 heart rate measurements per minute shows detailed, realistic fluctuations. On the right, a 2019 workout with only 0.7 samples per minute has been heavily interpolated, resulting in smooth lines. This quality difference posed a challenge for model training."

### Batch Size Search
> "We conducted systematic hyperparameter tuning, varying batch sizes from 8 to 64. These training curves show that batch sizes of 16-32 provide the best trade-off between training speed and generalization performance. Larger batches of 64 converge faster but generalize slightly worse."

### Test Evaluation
> "This comprehensive 8-panel evaluation plot shows model performance on the test set. The scatter plot shows predicted versus actual heart rates, with most points near the diagonal. The error histogram is centered near zero. Time-series examples show the model captures general trends but struggles with rapid transitions during interval workouts."

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Image Formats
- **PNG:** ✅ Best quality, use for presentation

- **PDF:** ✅ Vector format, perfect for prints

### Resolution
- Most plots are generated at **300 DPI** (high quality)
- Safe to enlarge to half-slide or full-slide
