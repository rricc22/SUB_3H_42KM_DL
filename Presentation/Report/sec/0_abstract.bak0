Predicting heart rate (HR) from running activity data is crucial for health monitoring and fitness tracking. This project aimed to predict HR time-series from speed and altitude sequences using deep learning. We trained LSTM, GRU, and Llama models on 13,000 filtered Endomondo workouts, achieving a best MAE of 13.64 BPM—falling short of our $<10$ BPM target. Analysis revealed a critical bottleneck: weak speed-HR correlation ($r=0.254$) due to sparse, crowdsourced HR data. To test whether high-quality data could overcome this limitation, we fine-tuned the model on 189 Apple Watch workouts with dense HR sampling (10-12 measurements/min), achieving $r=0.68$ correlation. This enabled a validation MAE of \textbf{9.61 BPM} and test MAE of 11.03 BPM—a 30\% error reduction. Our work demonstrates that data quality, not architectural complexity, is the primary factor in accurate HR prediction.
