\section{Conclusion}

This project explored heart rate prediction through two phases: (1) baseline models on 13,855 Endomondo workouts achieved MAE 13.64 BPM, limited by weak correlation ($r=0.254$); (2) transfer learning on 189 Apple Watch workouts with dense HR sampling improved correlation to $r=0.68$ and achieved \textbf{9.61 BPM validation MAE}, meeting our target.

\textbf{Key Lessons:} (1) Data quality $>$ model complexity—189 high-quality samples outperformed 13,855 noisy samples; (2) Correlation acts as a performance ceiling; (3) Transfer learning enables personalization with minimal data by freezing lower layers.

\textbf{Future Work:} Multi-user validation, real GPS integration (191 workouts with GPX available), few-shot learning ($<10$ BPM with only 10-20 workouts), and real-time wearable deployment. The path to sub-5 BPM accuracy lies in denser data from modern wearables, not more complex architectures.
